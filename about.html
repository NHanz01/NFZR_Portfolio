        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 5px;">
          My name is Nurul Farhana Binti Zainal Rashid, and usually known as Hana. I was born in Kuala Lumpur and currently living 
          with my family in Putra Permai City, located between Seri Kembangan and Puchong, Selangor D.E. Being the fourth born out 
          of six siblings, I grew up in a lively and warm family. I would describe myself as <b>determined, witty, and eager to learn 
          more</b>. My MBTI is INFJ. I have a diploma in Computer Science (Multimedia) and currently pursuing Bachelor in Computer 
          Science (Graphics and Multimedia Software) With Honours at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor, Malaysia. 
          <br><br>
          I'm still exploring the opportunities the computer science field offers since it's a vast area. Currently, my main interests
          are UI/UX design and game development. However, I'm open to any position as I'm interested in gaining more knowledge and 
          real-life working experience in computer science. I may be a rookie, but I'm eager to learn everything I can from my seniors.
          I have faith in both my perseverance and capability to adapt. Besides, I was known among my peers as the compassionated friend with the keenest eyes for details!

          Speaking about my past working experiences, during diploma, I've been doing a four-month internship at OFO Tech Sdn Bhd as a 
          <b>UI/UX Designer Intern</b>. Throughout the industrial training, my primary tasks consisted of designing user interfaces (UI) and icons for 
          various usage in the systems developed by OFO Tech using Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator. Other than that, I assist in 
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) development by labelling raw images using LabelImg by Pypi.org. To make use of my free time 
          during the internship, I would sometimes study the concepts of User Experience (UX) for better UI designations and explore 
          Figma for future UI/UX projects usage. <br><br>

          Other than that, I've worked as <b>logistics data entry assistant</b> at Preferred Logistics Solutions Sdn Bhd during my semester 
          break. My tasks consists updating the system daily, checking the daily delivery route, keeping track of the parcels, helping 
          with packaging and assist the senior workers with manifest documentation. <br><br>

          Finally, I've also worked as a <b>freelance video editor</b> under UTM BPAT in project with CIBD MYCREST. I am able to use 
          editing software such as Sony Vegas Pro and Adobe After Effect.<br><br>
